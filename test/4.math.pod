Some simple Math:

  ## A simple definition:
  A = B

  ## Now multiply both side by A:
  A**2 = AB

  ## Now add A**2 - 2AB in both sides:
  A**2 + A**2 - 2AB = AB + A**2 - 2AB

  ## That we can simplify by:
  2(A**2 -AB) = A**2 - AB

  ## And finally we divide both sides by A**2 - AB:
  2 = 1

=over 10

=item Soo, 2 is really equal 1?

=item But we didn't anything wrong!

=item Hummm, take a deep look!
